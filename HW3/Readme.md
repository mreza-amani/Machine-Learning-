# Air Pollution Data Analysis (MP3 Assignment)

This repository contains the notebook **`MP3_AmaniTaheri.ipynb`**, which explores and analyzes air quality data (PM2.5) in Beijing.  
The project is part of an assignment and demonstrates skills in **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** using Python.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this notebook is to:
- Load and preprocess the **PRSA Air Quality dataset**.
- Perform **exploratory data analysis** (EDA).
- Visualize important features and correlations.
- Investigate patterns in **PM2.5 pollution levels**.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is:

- **Name:** PRSA Data (Beijing, 2010–2014)  
- **File:** `PRSA_data_2010.1.1-2014.12.31.csv`  
- **Description:** Hourly air pollution data (PM2.5, weather, and other environmental factors).  
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data)
